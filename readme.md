Support for MIDI over USB and BLE tba - Version 2 of Hans now runs on RPI PICO W and is programmed in C. Hans is a 0hp/ inner case solution connecting directly to the i2c bus and er301 and Txo modules. This is the first draft of this new version. Hardware and enclosure exist, not yet available, not yet open sourced. No ETA on a "stable" version or release. What we have here is known to be fully working though.
