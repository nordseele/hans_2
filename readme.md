#### Hans 2

Hans 2 converts OSC UDP and serial MIDI to II and sends that over I2C to ER-301 and TXo.  
(Support for MIDI over USB and BLE tba)
Version 2 of Hans now runs on RPI PICO W and is programmed in C.
This is the first draft. Hardware and enclosure exist, not yet available, not yet open sourced. 
Personal project, work in progress. No ETA on a commercial version.
Version: 0.1
